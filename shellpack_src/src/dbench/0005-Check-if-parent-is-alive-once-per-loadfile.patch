Subject: [PATCH] Check if parent is alive once per loadfile processed

strace reports that a high percentage of time is spent calling kill()
with 12,000,000 calls in 3 minutes. Check if the parent is alive once per
load file processed. With later versions of apparmor, kill() is permission
checked which is very expensive in itself and unnecessary.  Instead use
the ligher getppid() call and check against the cached value.
